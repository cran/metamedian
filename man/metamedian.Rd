\code{sd.g1} \tab sample standard deviation. \cr
\code{med.var.g1} \tab sampling variance of the median (only applicable when \code{median_method="cd"}). \cr

\item{median_method}{character string specifying the approach used to estimate the study-specific means and their standard errors. The options are
\tabular{ll}{
\code{"mm"} \tab Median of Medians (McGrath et al. 2019) for one-group studies and Median of the Difference of Medians (McGrath et al. 2020) for two group studies. \cr

\code{"cd"} \tab Confidence Distribution (Ozturk and Balakrishnan 2020). This approach is applicable for one-group studies. \cr}}

\item{single.family}{(only applicable when \code{median_method} is set to \code{"qe"}) logical scalar indicating that for two-group studies, the parametric family of distributions is assumed to be the same across both groups. The default is \code{FALSE}. See 'Details' of \code{\link{qe.study.level}}.}

\item{loc.shift}{(only applicable when \code{median_method} is set to \code{"qe"}) logical scalar indicating that for two-group studies, distributions are assumed to only differ by a location shift. The default is \code{FALSE}. See 'Details' of \code{\link{qe.study.level}}.}

\item{norm.approx}{(only applicable when \code{median_method} is set to \code{"mm"} or \code{"wm"}) logical scalar indicating whether normality approximation of the binomial should be used to construct an approximate confidence interval. The default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{coverage.prob}{(only applicable when \code{median_method} is set to \code{"mm"}, \code{"wm"}, or \code{"cd"}) numeric scalar indicating the desired coverage probability for the pooled (difference of medians) estimate. The default is \code{0.95}.}

\item{cd_method}{(only applicable when \code{median_method} is set to \code{"cd"}) character string specifying whether a fixed effect or random effects model is used. The options are \code{FE} (fixed effect) are \code{RE} (random effects). The default is \code{RE}.}

\item{pool_studies}{logical scalar specifying whether to meta-analyze the studies. If this argument is set to \code{FALSE}, function will not meta-analyze the studies and will return a list with components \code{yi} containing the study-specific outcome measure estimates and \code{sei} containing the study-specific within-study standard error estimates. The default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{...}{(only applicable when \code{median_method} is set to \code{"qe"}) optional arguments that are passed into the \code{\link[metafor]{rma.uni}} function for pooling. See documentation of \code{\link[metafor]{rma.uni}}.}

\value{
an object of class "rma.uni" (when \code{median_method} is set to \code{"qe"}) or a list (when \code{median_method} is set to \code{"mm"}, \code{"wm"}, or \code{"cd"}). For additional details, see \code{\link[metafor]{rma.uni}} (when \code{median_method} is set to \code{"qe"}), \code{\link{pool.med}} (when \code{median_method} is set to \code{"mm"} or \code{"wm"}), and \code{\link{cd}} (when \code{median_method} is set to \code{"cd"}).

\description{
This function is a wrapper function for the \code{\link{qe}}, \code{\link{cd}}, and \code{\link{pool.med}} functions. The function implements the methods of McGrath et al. (2019), McGrath et al. (2020), and Ozturk and Balakrishnan (2020) to estimate the pooled (difference of) medians in a meta-analysis. Specifically, the function implements the (weighted) median of medians method, the Ozturk and Balakrishnan (2020) method, and the quantile matching estimation method to meta-analyze one-group studies; the function implements the (weighted) median of the difference of medians method and quantile matching estimation method to meta-analyze two-group studies.
